Automatically run your Elixir project's tests each time you save a file.
Because TDD is awesome.


## Usage

Add it to your dependencies

```elixir
# mix.exs
def deps do
  [{:mix_test_watch, "~> 0.2", only: :dev}]
end
```

Run the mix task

```
mix test.watch
```

Start hacking :)


## Running Additional Mix Tasks

Through the mix config it is possible to run other mix tasks as well as the
test task. For example, if I wished to run the [Dogma][dogma] code style
linter after my tests I would do so like this.

[dogma]: https://github.com/lpil/dogma

```elixir
use Mix.Config

config :mix_test_watch,
  tasks: [
    "test",
    "dogma",
  ]
```

Tasks are run in the order they appear in the list, and the progression will
stop if any command returns a non-zero exit code.

All tasks are run with `MIX_ENV` set to `test`.


## Passing Arguments To Tasks

Any command line arguments passed to the `test.watch` task will be passed
through to the tasks being run. If I only want to run the tests from one file
every time I save a file I could do so with this command:

```
mix test.watch test/file/to_test.exs
```

Note that if you have configured more than one task to be run these arguments
will be passed to all the tasks run, not just the test command.


## Compatibility Notes

On Linux you may need to install `inotify-tools`.

On Windows I've no idea. If anyone knows how to use Windows and would like to
help, please get in touch.
